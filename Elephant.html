    <P>Elephants are large mmamals of the family elephantidae and the order proboscidea.Two species are traditionaly recognised,the african elephant(loxondota africana) and the Asian elephant(Elephas maximus),although some evidance suggests that African  bush elephant and African forest elephantsare separate species(L.african and L.cyclotic respectively).Elephants are scattered throughout sub-harana Africa,south asia and Southeast asia.Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order proposcidea;other,now extinct,members of the order include deinotheres,gomphotheres,mammoths,and mastodos.male african elephants are the large extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height 4m(13ft)and weight 7,000 kg(15,000 lb>).</P>
    <p>All elephants have several distinctive fearures,the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis,used for many purposes,particular breathing, lifting water and grasping object.their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as a weapon and tools for moving object and digging.elephants' large ear flap help to control their temperature.their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight.African elephants have large ears and concave backs while.</p>
    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitas including savannah,forests, desert and marshes. they prefer to stay  near water.</p>
